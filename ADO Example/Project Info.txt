# Project: ASP.NET Web Application (.Net Framework)
An ASP.NET Web Application is a full-fledged web application that includes a frontend (UI) and a backend (server-side logic). It is typically built using ASP.NET MVC, Razor Pages, or Blazor.

✅ Key Features:
✔ Has a User Interface (UI) → Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Razor Views.
✔ Handles both frontend and backend → Users interact with the application directly.
✔ Uses MVC (Model-View-Controller) or Razor Pages to structure the app.
✔ Ideal for websites, admin panels, dashboards, e-commerce platforms, etc.
